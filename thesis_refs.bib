abstract = {We present fast, accurate, direct non-projective dependency parsers with third-order features. Our approach uses AD3, an accelerated dual decomposition algorithm which we extend to handle specialized head automata and sequential head bigram models. Experiments in fourteen languages yield parsing speeds competitive to projective parsers, with state-of- the-art accuracies for the largest datasets (English, Czech, and German).},

@article{Martins2009,
abstract = {Recent approaches to learning structured predictors often require approximate infer- ence for tractability; yet its effects on the learned model are unclear. Meanwhile, most learning algorithms act as if computational cost was constant within the model class. This paper sheds some light on the first issue by establishing risk bounds for max-margin learning with LP relaxed inference and ad- dresses the second issue by proposing a new paradigm that attempts to penalize “time- consuming” hypotheses. Our analysis relies on a geometric characterization of the outer polyhedra associated with the LP relaxation. We then apply these techniques to the prob- lem of dependency parsing, for which a con- cise LP formulation is provided that handles non-local output features. A significant im- provement is shown over arc-factored models.},

abstract = {Classical coreference systems encode various syntactic, discourse, and semantic phenomena explicitly, using heterogenous features com-puted from hand-crafted heuristics. In con-trast, we present a state-of-the-art coreference system that captures such phenomena implic-itly, with a small number of homogeneous feature templates examining shallow proper-ties of mentions. Surprisingly, our features are actually more effective than the corre-sponding hand-engineered ones at modeling these key linguistic phenomena, allowing us to win " easy victories " without crafted heuris-tics. These features are successful on syntax and discourse; however, they do not model semantic compatibility well, nor do we see gains from experiments with shallow seman-tic features from the literature, suggesting that this approach to semantics is an " uphill bat-tle. " Nonetheless, our final system 1 outper-forms the Stanford system (Lee et al. (2011), the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task) by 3.5{\%} absolute on the CoNLL metric and outperforms the IMS system (Bj{\"{o}}rkelund and Farkas (2012), the best publicly available En-glish coreference system) by 1.9{\%} absolute.},

abstract = {Can we train a system that, on any new input, either says "don't know" or makes a prediction that is guaranteed to be correct? We answer the question in the affirmative provided our model family is well-specified. Specifically, we introduce the unanimity principle: only predict when all models consistent with the training data predict the same output. We operationalize this principle for semantic parsing, the task of mapping utterances to logical forms. We develop a simple, efficient method that reasons over the infinite set of all consistent models by only checking two of the models. We prove that our method obtains 100{\%} precision even with a modest amount of training data from a possibly adversarial distribution. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard GeoQuery dataset.},

Despite the compactness of this model and, more importantly, the arbitrary nature of the form-function relationship in language, our "composed" word representations yield state-of-the-art results in language modeling and part-of-speech tagging. Benefits over traditional baselines are particularly pronounced in morphologically rich languages (e.g., Turkish).},

abstract = {Almost all current dependency parsers classify based on millions of sparse indi-cator features. Not only do these features generalize poorly, but the cost of feature computation restricts parsing speed signif-icantly. In this work, we propose a novel way of learning a neural network classifier for use in a greedy, transition-based depen-dency parser. Because this classifier learns and uses just a small number of dense fea-tures, it can work very fast, while achiev-ing an about 2{\%} improvement in unla-beled and labeled attachment scores on both English and Chinese datasets. Con-cretely, our parser is able to parse more than 1000 sentences per second at 92.2{\%} unlabeled attachment score on the English Penn Treebank.},

Our formulation is able to handle non-local output features in an efficient manner; not only is it compatible with prior knowledge encoded as hard constraints, it can also learn soft constraints from data. In particular, our model is able to learn correlations among neighboring arcs (siblings and grandparents), word valency, and tendencies toward nearly-projective parses. The model parameters are learned in a max-margin framework by employing a linear programming relaxation. We evaluate the performance of our parser on data in several natural languages, achieving improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.},
